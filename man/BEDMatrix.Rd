\title{Create a BEDMatrix Object from a PLINK .bed File.}
\usage{
BEDMatrix(path, n = NULL, p = NULL, simple_names = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the
\href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed}{.bed} file (with or
without extension).}

\item{n}{The number of samples. If \code{NULL} (the default), this number will be
determined from the accompanying
\href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#fam}{.fam} file (of the same
name as the \href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed}{.bed} file).
If a positive integer, the .fam file is not read and \code{rownames} will be set
to \code{NULL} and have to be provided manually.}

\item{p}{The number of variants. If \code{NULL} (the default) the number of
variants will be determined from the accompanying
\href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bim}{.bim} file (of the same
name as the \href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed}{.bed} file).
If a positive integer, the .bim file is not read and \code{colnames} will be set
to \code{NULL} and have to be provided manually.}

\item{simple_names}{Whether to simplify the format of the dimension names.
If \code{FALSE} (the default), row names are concatenations of family IDs, \code{_},
and within-family IDs, while column names are concatenations of variant
names, \code{_}, and minor alleles. If \code{TRUE}, row names are within-family IDs
only and column names are variant names only.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{BEDMatrix} object.
}
\description{
This function constructs a new \linkS4class{BEDMatrix} object by mapping the
specified \href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed}{PLINK .bed} file
into memory.
}
\details{
\href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed}{.bed} files must be
accompanied by \href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#fam}{.fam} and
\href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bim}{.bim} files: .fam files
contain sample information, and .bim files contain variant information. If
the name of the .bed file is \emph{plink}.bed then the names of the .fam and .bim
files have to be \emph{plink}.fam and \emph{plink}.bim, respectively. The .fam and
.bim files are used to extract the number and names of samples and variants.

For very large .bed files, reading the .fam and .bim files can take a long
time. If \code{n} and \code{p} are provided, these files are not read and \code{dimnames}
have to be provided manually.

Currently, only the variant-major mode of .bed files is supported.
\href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/}{PLINK2} "dropped" support for the
sample-major mode by automatically converting files in this format to the
variant-major mode. Therefore, it is recommended to run files in
sample-major mode through PLINK2 first.

\examples{
# Get the path to the example .bed file
path <- system.file("extdata", "example.bed", package = "BEDMatrix")

# Create a BEDMatrix object the example .bed file
m1 <- BEDMatrix(path)

# Create a BEDMatrix object the example .bed file without loading the .fam and
# .bim files
m2 <- BEDMatrix(path, n = 50, p = 1000)

# Alternatively, a BEDMatrix object can also be created using the `new`
# function
m3 <- new("BEDMatrix", path = path)
