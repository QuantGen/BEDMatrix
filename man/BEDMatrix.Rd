\title{Creates a matrix wrapper around binary PED files.}
\usage{
BEDMatrix(path, n = NULL, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the binary PED file.}

\item{n}{The number of individuals. Optional if FAM file of same name as BED
file exists.}

\item{p}{The number of markers. Optional if MAP file of same name as BED file
exists.}
}
\description{
\code{BEDMatrix} is an S3 class that behaves similarly to a regular
\code{matrix} by implementing key methods such as \code{[}, \code{dim}, and
\code{dimnames}. Subsets are extracted directly and on-demand from the binary
PED file without loading the entire file into memory through memory mapping.
}
\details{
A \code{BEDMatrix} instance can be created by providing the path to the BED
file as \code{path}, the number of individuals as \code{n}, and the number of
markers as \code{p}. If a FAM file (which corresponds to the first six
columns of a PED file) of the same name and in the same directory as the BED
file exists, it is optional to provide \code{n} and the number of individuals
as well as the rownames of the \code{BEDMatrix} will be detected
automatically. If a BIM file (which corresponds to the MAP file that
accompanies a PED file) of the same name and in the same directory as the BED
file exists, it is optional to provide \code{p} and the number of markers as
well as the colnames of the \code{BEDMatrix} will be detected automatically.
For very large BED file it is advised to provide \code{n} and \code{p}
manually to speed up object creation.

A BED file can be created from a PED file with
\href{http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/}{PLINK} using \code{plink
--file myfile --make-bed}. BED files are storage and query efficient, and can
be transformed back into the original PED file with PLINK using \code{plink
--bfile myfile --recode}.

Internally, \code{BEDMatrix} inherits from \code{list} and
exposes a few attributes that should not be relied upon in actual code:
\code{path}, \code{dims}, \code{dnames}, and \code{_instance}. \code{path}
stores the path to the BED file. \code{dims} and \code{dnames} contain the
dimensions and dimnames of the BEDMatrix object. \code{_instance} points to
the underlying \code{Rcpp} module. The \code{Rcpp} module exposes an S4 class
called \code{BEDMatrix_} that memory maps the BED file via
\code{Boost.Interprocess} of the \code{BH} package.
