\title{Creates a Matrix Wrapper Around Binary PED Files.}
\usage{
BEDMatrix(path, n = NULL, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the binary PED file, with or without extension.}

\item{n}{The number of individuals. Optional if FAM file of same name as BED
file exists. If provided, \code{rownames} will be set to \code{NULL} and have to be
provided manually.}

\item{p}{The number of markers. Optional if BIM file of same name as BED
file exists. If provided, \code{colnames} will be set to \code{NULL} and have to be
provided manually.}
}
\description{
\code{BEDMatrix} is an S3 class that behaves similarly to a regular \code{matrix} by
implementing key methods such as \code{[}, \code{dim}, and \code{dimnames}. Subsets are
extracted directly and on-demand from the binary PED file without loading
the entire file into memory through memory mapping. The subsets are coded
similarly to RAW files generated with the \code{--recodeA} argument in PLINK: \code{0}
indicates homozygous major allele, \code{1} indicates heterozygous, and \code{2}
indicates homozygous minor allele.

\details{
A \code{BEDMatrix} instance can be created by providing the path to the BED file
(with or without extension) as \code{path}, the number of individuals as \code{n}, and
the number of markers as \code{p}. If a FAM file (which corresponds to the first
six columns of a PED file) of the same name and in the same directory as the
BED file exists, it is optional to provide \code{n} and the number of individuals
as well as the rownames of the \code{BEDMatrix} will be detected automatically.
The rownames will be generated based on the IID and FID of each individual,
concatenated by \code{_}.  If a BIM file (which corresponds to the MAP file that
accompanies a PED file) of the same name and in the same directory as the
BED file exists, it is optional to provide \code{p} and the number of markers as
well as the colnames of the \code{BEDMatrix} will be detected automatically. The
colnames will be generated based on the SNP name and the minor allele,
concatenated by \code{_} (similar to the colnames in a RAW file). For very large
BED file it is advised to provide \code{n} and \code{p} manually to speed up object
creation. In that case \code{rownames} and \code{colnames} will be set to \code{NULL} and
have to be specified manually.

A BED file can be created from a PED file with
\href{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2}{PLINK} using \code{plink --file myfile --make-bed}. BED files are storage and query efficient, and can be
transformed back into the original PED file with PLINK using \code{plink --bfile myfile --recode}.

Internally, \code{BEDMatrix} inherits from \code{list} and exposes a few attributes
that should not be relied upon in actual code: \code{path}, \code{dims}, \code{dnames}, and
\code{_instance}. \code{path} stores the path to the BED file. \code{dims} and \code{dnames}
contain the dimensions and dimnames of the BEDMatrix object. \code{_instance}
points to the underlying \code{Rcpp} module. The \code{Rcpp} module exposes an S4
class called \code{BEDMatrix_} that memory maps the BED file via
\code{Boost.Interprocess} of the \code{BH} package.
