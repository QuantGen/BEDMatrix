\title{Creates a matrix wrapper around a binary PED file.}
\usage{
BEDMatrix(path, n = NULL, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the binary PED file.}

\item{n}{The number of individuals. Optional if FAM file of same name as BED
file exists.}

\item{p}{The number of markers. Optional if MAP file of same name as BED file
exists.}
}
\description{
The binary PED file will not be loaded into memory. Rather, subsets are
extracted 'on the fly'.
}
\details{
If a FAM or MAP file with the same name as the binary PED file (minus the
extension) exists within the same folder, \code{n} and \code{p} as well as
rownames and colnames will be automatically determined from those files.
To skip this, provide \code{n} and \code{p} manually.
